# Today's tutorial

We'll cover:
- Shifting from R script files + lots of `#comments` to RMarkdown notebooks
- Turning your R code into HTML, PDFs, and Word docs with knitr
- Enhancing your RMarkdown files with text formatting and presentation options
- Doing more with code chunks: SQL queries & background jobs

We'll do this through:
- Quick overview of the RMarkdown universe and key terms
- Hands on practice creating a well-formatted report
   - Please install _______ now if you don't have them already

We won't get to:
- Making presentations with xaringen or beamer
- Making a personal website with blogdown

But!! 
- The last slide will have loads of links with resources to do everything

# What is RMarkdown?

---

# RMarkdown

---

# The world of RMarkdown


---

# Scenarios

- Researcher: .R files -> Rmd notebooks
- Data analysts/scientists: authoring reports in PDF, Word, or HTML
- Show the world: `blogdown`, `flexdashboard`

---

# Some vocabulary

- `code chunk`: 
- `chunk options`: 
- `inline code`: 
- `knit`: 
- `render`:

# Tutorial Time!

# From Rscripts to R Notebooks

1. Open the **analysis1.R** file 
2. Create a new RMarkdown document using **New -> R Notebook**
3. Try migrating everything from the .R file to the new R Notebook
4. When you're ready, save the file and click **Preview**

How did you organize the comments and code from the R script?

Did you use multiple code chunks?

How would you use a Notebook(s) to capture the research process?

---

# Building a report

1. Create a new RMarkdown document using **New -> R Markdown...**
2. Give your new file a Title and Author in the window that pops up
3. Check out and save your new file!
4. Click **Knit** to create the rendered HTML file

---

# Time to knit

1. **Knit -> Knit to HTML**
  - Usually goes smoothly 
2. **Knit -> Knit to Word**
  - If you have MS Word, this usually works fine
3. **Knit -> Knit to PDF**
  - Get an error message? 
  - Is it about not having a LaTeX installation?
  - Cool, try these two steps:
     1. `install.packages("tinytex")`
     2. `tinytex::install_tinytex()`
     3. Try knitting to PDF again

# Let's get fancy!

Folks that have used RMarkdown before - what are some things you always change?

Edit the YAML header to add: 
- A Table of Contents
- Code folding (show/hide the code via buttons)

Edit the body of the report:
- Can you make a bulleted list?
- Add a [URL](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)?

Tidy up the code chunks:
- Hide package loading messages
- Change figure size

# Polyglot Markdown!

You can use languages other than R in your code chunks. Python, bash, SQL, Ruby, they're all options!

R chunk: 
```{r}
# Here's a normal R chunk, setting up a SQL database connection
library(DBI)
library(reclues)
con <- reclues::get_db()
```

SQL chunk: 
```{sql comment='--', connection=con}
-- Chunk options: "{sql comment='--', connection=con}"
select * from crime_scene_report limit 2
```

---

# Polyglot Markdown!

To return the result of a SQL query to your Global Environment, add `output.var="reports"` to the chunk options.

```{sql comment='--', connection=con, output.var="reports"}
select * from crime_scene_report
```

```{r}
str(reports)
```

# Background Jobs

The RStudio IDE now has background jobs! Cool! The main idea is to use the Jobs pane (next to Console) to run an Rscript in the background and return the results to your R session.

Why use background jobs?
* Frees up the console so you can keep working in the same session
* Another option for parallelization, you can have multiple background jobs running
* You're training models, and they're verrrrryyyy slowww.... or verrrryyyy verboooooseeeee.... or both (I'm looking at you Stan)!
---

# Background Jobs

So how can we use background jobs in a **Notebook** context? 

If we're talking about using a Notebook as a living, literate document made up of code and text, describing your research process - then you might encounter scenarios where you want to keep working while something is running.

What you're about to see is my current solution, there might be better ones out there!

---

# Background Jobs

We'll use the `callr` package:

* Your code must be wrapped up as a function using `r_bg()`
* You need to explicity give `r_bg()` anything from the GE that it needs to run
* Capture messages and errors by specifying .err and .out files

```{r}
library(callr)


```

# Final tips & tricks

**Q.  Help! Everything (paragraphs, lists) is running together!**  
**A.**  Add 2+ spaces to the end of the sentence or list item. Change your RStudio settings (Preferences -> Code -> Display) to show whitespace characters. 


**Q.  Help! I'm getting weird errors when I run my code chunks... I swear it worked 15min ago.**  
**A.**  Watch out for accidentally running code chunks out of order. Unlike Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown docs don't put little numbers next to your chunks + output to help you keep track of what order things were run. 


**Q.  This document took 15 minutes to knit, and I just found a typo. Argh! How can I speed this up??**  
**A.**  Look into caching those time-intensive code chunks! It won't help you in the moment, but future you will be glad you cached when you catch the next typo. 

**Q.  I need to repeat this exact process/report every month/on every sample, how can reduce the copy/pasting?**  
**A.**  Parameterized reports to the rescue! Make a template file, set your variables (e.g. sample name & filepath, or month) in the YAML header, and knit!

**Tip**  You can use RMarkdown notebooks like a paper lab notebook, or a polished protocol, but its hard to make a single notebook do both well. 

a log of what you've tried and what you conclude about the results of each experiment. You can also use them more like a lab protocol or Methods section, where you take the final version and
