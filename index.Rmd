# Today's tutorial

We'll cover:
- Shifting from R script files + lots of `#comments` to RMarkdown notebooks
- Turning your R code into HTML, PDFs, and Word docs with knitr
- Enhancing your RMarkdown files with text formatting and presentation options
- Doing more with code chunks: SQL queries & background jobs

We'll do this through:
- Quick overview of the RMarkdown universe and key terms
- Hands on practice creating a well-formatted report

We won't get to:
- Making presentations with xaringan
- Making a personal website with blogdown

But!! 
- The last slide will have loads of links with resources to do those things

# What is RMarkdown?

---

# RMarkdown

* Technically, `R Markdown` is an extension of Markdown, a language for authoring formatted documents in plain text 

* Less technically, RMarkdown is a way to mix code with explanatory text in a variety of ways

* Philosophically, RMarkdown can be a gateway to literate programming in R

# The world of RMarkdown

* R Notebooks - pieces of R code can be run interactively, showing printed results underneath
  
* R Markdown Documents - designed to capture a more static code+text document in a final form like PDF, Word, or HTML
  
* Presentations - multiple ways to produce slide decks using R Markdown (4 options within `rmarkdown` itself, plus the `xaringan` package)
  
* Websites - R Markdown files combine into a website with the `blogdown` package

* Books - one chaper per R Markdown file, extra functionality from `bookdown`

* And more! 
---

# Scenarios

* Researcher: .R files -> Rmd notebooks

* Data analysts/scientists: authoring reports in PDF, Word, or HTML

* Show the world: `blogdown`, `flexdashboard`

---

# Some vocabulary, from top to bottom

* `YAML`: the header to every Markdown file, specifies what the output should be and look like

* `code chunk`: a block of code, beginning and ending with 3 back quotes

* `chunk options`: determine how each code chunk behaves, e.g. {r fig.width=8}

* `inline code`: a little piece of code tucked into your text, e.g. to reference a number calculated in a chunk

* `knit`: the process of converting R Markdown (.Rmd) to regular Markdown (.md) via the `knitr` package, and then converting the Markdown to a final output format using the `pandoc` package

# Tutorial Time!

# Building a report

## Exercise
1. Create a new RMarkdown document using **New -> R Markdown...**

2. Give your new file a Title and Author in the window that pops up

3. Check out the and save your new file!

## Discuss
* What Markdown formatting do you see?  

* What's the name of the first code chunk?  

* Notice anything else?
---

# Time to knit

## Exercise
1. **Knit -> Knit to HTML**
  - Usually goes smoothly 
  
2. **Knit -> Knit to Word**
  - If you have MS Word, this usually works fine
  
3. **Knit -> Knit to PDF**
  - Get an error message? 
  - Is it about not having a LaTeX installation?
  - Cool, try these two steps:
     1. `install.packages("tinytex")`
     2. `tinytex::install_tinytex()`
     3. Try knitting to PDF again

---

# From Rscripts to R Notebooks

## Exercise  
1. Open the **tutorial_rscript.R** file 

2. Create a new RMarkdown document using **New -> R Notebook**

3. Try migrating everything from the .R file to the new R Notebook

4. When you're ready, save the file and click **Preview**


## Discuss
* How did you organize the comments and code from the R script?

* Did you use multiple code chunks?

* How would you use a Notebook(s) to capture the research process?

---

# Let's get fancy!

### Exercise 
1. Edit the **YAML** header to add:  
  - A Table of Contents
  - Code folding (show/hide the code via buttons)

2. Edit the **body** of the report:
  - Can you make a bulleted list?
  - Add a [URL](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)?

3. Tidy up the **code chunks**:
  - Hide package loading messages
  - Change figure size

### If you've used RMarkdown before - what are some things you always change?

---

# Polyglot Markdown!

You can use languages other than R in your code chunks. Python, bash, SQL, Ruby, they're all options!

**R chunk** `{r}`
```{r}
# Here's a normal R chunk, setting up a SQL database connection
library(DBI)
library(reclues)
con <- reclues::get_db()
```

**SQL chunk** `{sql comment='--', connection=con}`
```{sql comment='--', connection=con}
-- Chunk options: "{sql comment='--', connection=con}"
select * from crime_scene_report limit 2
```

---

# Polyglot Markdown!

To return the result of a SQL query to your Global Environment, add `output.var="reports"` to the chunk options.

```{sql comment='--', connection=con, output.var="reports"}
select * from crime_scene_report
```

```{r}
str(reports)
```

---

# Background Jobs

The RStudio IDE now has background jobs! Cool! The main idea is to use the Jobs pane (next to Console) to run an Rscript in the background and return the results to your R session.

Why use background jobs with R Markdown?
* Frees up the console so you can keep working in the same session

* Another option for parallelization, you can have multiple background jobs running

* You're training models in a notebook, and they're very slow, or very verbose ... or both (I'm looking at you Stan)!
---

# Background Jobs

So how can we use background jobs in a **Notebook** context? 

If we're talking about using a Notebook as a living, literate document made up of code and text, describing your research process - then you might encounter scenarios where you want to keep working while something is running.

What you're about to see is my current solution, there might be better ones out there!

---

# Background Jobs

We'll use the `callr` package:

* Your code must be wrapped up as a function using `r_bg()`
* You need to explicity give `r_bg()` anything from the GE that it needs to run
* Capture messages and errors by specifying .err and .out files (optional)
* Running the code chunk submits the job

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(callr)

slow_code <- r_bg(function(x) {
  
  message("Going to wait a bit so we can see the results of $is.alive()")
  Sys.sleep(60)
  
  crime_summary <- x %>% 
    group_by(type) %>% 
    summarize(occurances= n())
  
  return(crime_summary)
  },
args = list(x = reports), #reports is a dataframe in our global environment
stdout = "./tmp/callr_example.out",
stderr = "./tmp/callr_example.err"
  )
```

---

# Background Jobs

* Check the status of your job with `$is.alive()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
slow_code$is.alive()
```

* Tip: put your job objects in a list and use `purrr:map(job_list, function(x) x$is.alive)` to quickly see how they're all doing

* Once the job is dead (either finished or errored out), use $get_result() to return the result to your environment

```{r eval=FALSE}
crime_summary <- slow_code$get_result()
```

# Final tips & tricks

**Q.  Help! Everything (paragraphs, lists) is running together!**  
**A.**  Add 2+ spaces to the end of the sentence or list item. Change your RStudio settings (Preferences -> Code -> Display) to show whitespace characters. 


**Q.  Help! I'm getting weird errors when I run my code chunks... I swear it worked 15min ago.**  
**A.**  Watch out for accidentally running code chunks out of order. Unlike Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown docs don't put little numbers next to your chunks + output to help you keep track of what order things were run. 


**Q.  This document took 15 minutes to knit, and I just found a typo. Argh! How can I speed this up??**  
**A.**  Look into caching those time-intensive code chunks! It won't help you in the moment, but future you will be glad you cached when you catch the next typo. 

**Q.  I need to repeat this exact process/report every month/on every sample, how can reduce the copy/pasting?**  
**A.**  Parameterized reports to the rescue! Make a template file, set your variables (e.g. sample name & filepath, or month) in the YAML header, and knit!
